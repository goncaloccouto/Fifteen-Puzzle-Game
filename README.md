# Fifteen-Puzzle-Game
A “smarter” approach on the traditional fifteen puzzle game. This is a work I did with two other colleagues for our Artificial Intelligence course, it was our first project. This covers some interesting algorithms including BFS, DFS, A* and Iterative deepening DFS.

## Installation
There is no installation, just download the files as zip and extract to a location of your choosing.

## Usage
In the folder where you have all the files do "javac .*java" to compile each folder at once, after this is done just do "java fifteenGame" and follow on screen instructions.
